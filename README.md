In many developing countries  small to midsize businesses often manage their IT infrastructure through their own servers and physical devices. While this approach can save costs and provide flexibility, it also poses challenges such as maintaining the equipment and ensuring its smooth operation. When issues occur, businesses must contact their technology providers or support teams, which can be time-consuming and impact business efficiency. To address this problem, I propose using IoT technology to streamline and automate infrastructure management.
