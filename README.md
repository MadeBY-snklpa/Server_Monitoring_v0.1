# Introduction 

In many developing countries  small to midsize businesses often manage their IT infrastructure through their own servers and physical devices. While this approach can save costs and provide flexibility, it also poses challenges such as maintaining the equipment and ensuring its smooth operation. When issues occur, businesses must contact their technology providers or support teams, which can be time-consuming and impact business efficiency. To address this problem, I propose using IoT technology to streamline and automate infrastructure management.


# Proposed Solution

The proposed solution for datacenter servers  monitoring involves the use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and a web interface. The IoT devices will be installed in various components of the datacenter, such as servers, storage devices, and cooling systems, to collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, fan functionality, and redundant power supply operational status.
The data collected by the IoT devices will be transmitted to a centralized cloud platform, where it will be processed and analyzed. The web interface will be designed to access this data and provide real-time monitoring and management capabilities to system administrators.
